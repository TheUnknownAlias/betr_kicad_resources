The high accuracy, fast measurement response time, and long-term stability, along with the small package size, makes the HS3003 ideal for a wide number of applications from portable to harsh environments.An integrated calibration and temperature compensation logic provides fully corrected RH and T values via a standard ICoutput. The measured data is internally corrected and compensated for accurate operation over a"
